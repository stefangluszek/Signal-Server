# Online users
If the recipient is online, has `fetchesMessages` attribute set to `true` the messages will be delivered through websocket. It's not directly pushed to the recipient websocket instead redis pub/sub functinoality is used. The receiver subscribe to a channel and the message is published to that channel. When you call publish in redis it return the number of clients that received the message. This is used to check if the message was delivered. If the message was not delivered through pub/sub we send the push notification and queue the message. Once the client connects after getting the push notification we will deliver queued messages.
# Offline users
For offline users messages are delivered with push notifications (APN or GCM).
# Notes
In a distributed Redis Cluster, only clients that are connected to the same node as the publishing client are included in the count. So messages will be delivered to the subscriber but if he is connected to a different redis node the delivery won't be included in the count. According to [Scaling Redis PubSub](https://redislabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Redis-Day-TLV-2018-Scaling-Redis-PubSub.pdf), but sinlge redis can handle 100k pub/sub operatoins per socond, perhaps that's enough.
